    { "context": "default", "input": "How do you create a character in D&D", "response": "To create a character in Dungeons & Dragons, you need to choose a race, class, and background. You'll also roll for ability scores and select skills, feats, and equipment. Don't forget to come up with a name and backstory for your character!" },
    { "context": "default", "input": "What are ability scores in D&D", "response": "Ability scores are numerical values that represent a character's physical and mental attributes. The six ability scores are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. They affect various aspects of gameplay, such as attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks." },
    { "context": "default", "input": "How do you roll for ability scores", "response": "There are several methods to roll for ability scores, but a common method is to roll four six-sided dice (4d6), drop the lowest roll, and sum the remaining three. Repeat this process six times and assign the totals to your ability scores as you see fit." },
    { "context": "default", "input": "What is a saving throw", "response": "A saving throw is a roll used to resist a spell, trap, poison, or other harmful effects. It is made by rolling a d20 and adding the appropriate ability modifier and proficiency bonus if applicable. The result is compared to the DC (Difficulty Class) of the effect." },
    { "context": "default", "input": "How does combat work in D&D", "response": "Combat in Dungeons & Dragons is turn-based. On your turn, you can move and take one action. Possible actions include attacking, casting a spell, or using an item. Initiative, which determines the order of turns, is decided by rolling a d20 and adding your Dexterity modifier." },
    { "context": "default", "input": "What is an attack roll", "response": "An attack roll is made to determine whether an attack hits its target. Roll a d20 and add your attack bonus (proficiency bonus plus the relevant ability modifier). If the result equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits." },
    { "context": "default", "input": "How do you cast a spell", "response": "To cast a spell, you need to have the spell prepared or known, have a spell slot of the appropriate level available, and meet any material components required. Then, you use your action to cast the spell, and the effects occur as described in the spell's description." },
    { "context": "default", "input": "What is a spell slot", "response": "Spell slots represent the number of spells a character can cast. Higher-level spells require higher-level spell slots. Once a spell is cast using a spell slot, that slot is expended until the character takes a long rest." },
    { "context": "default", "input": "What are hit points", "response": "Hit points (HP) represent a character's health. Damage reduces hit points, and when a character's hit points drop to 0, they fall unconscious and may die. Hit points can be restored through healing spells, potions, or taking a rest." },
    { "context": "default", "input": "What is a long rest", "response": "A long rest is an extended period of downtime, typically 8 hours, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity. After a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points, expended spell slots, and can use any abilities that require a long rest to recharge." },
    { "context": "default", "input": "What is a short rest", "response": "A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character can rest and perform light activities. During a short rest, a character can spend hit dice to recover hit points and may regain some class-specific abilities." },
    { "context": "default", "input": "What is advantage and disadvantage", "response": "Advantage and disadvantage are game mechanics that affect d20 rolls. When you have advantage, roll two d20s and use the higher result. When you have disadvantage, roll two d20s and use the lower result." },
    { "context": "default", "input": "How do you determine initiative", "response": "Initiative is determined at the start of combat by rolling a d20 and adding your Dexterity modifier. The result determines the order of turns in combat, with higher results going first." },
    { "context": "default", "input": "What is proficiency bonus", "response": "Proficiency bonus is a number added to certain rolls, such as attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, if the character is proficient in that activity. The proficiency bonus increases with the character's level." },
    { "context": "default", "input": "What is a Dungeon Master", "response": "The Dungeon Master (DM) is the game's referee and storyteller. The DM controls the game's narrative, manages non-player characters (NPCs), and adjudicates the rules. The DM also sets up and describes the environment, including encounters and challenges." },
    { "context": "default", "input": "What are non-player characters", "response": "Non-player characters (NPCs) are characters controlled by the Dungeon Master. NPCs can include allies, enemies, and neutral parties that interact with the player characters (PCs) in the game world." },
    { "context": "default", "input": "What is an ability check", "response": "An ability check is a roll to determine the success of an action that isn't an attack or saving throw. Roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier and proficiency bonus if applicable. Compare the result to the DC set by the DM to determine success or failure." },
    { "context": "default", "input": "What is a skill check", "response": "A skill check is a type of ability check that uses a specific skill. Roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier and proficiency bonus if you are proficient in the skill. Compare the result to the DC set by the DM to determine success or failure." },
    { "context": "default", "input": "How do you level up in D&D", "response": "Characters level up by gaining experience points (XP) through defeating monsters, completing quests, and achieving milestones. When enough XP is gained, a character advances to the next level, gaining new abilities, increased hit points, and improved proficiency bonus." }
